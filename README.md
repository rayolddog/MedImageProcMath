Medical image processing with Mathematica
repository is for Mathematica code segmenting an axial CT body image into body pixels, and non body pixels. The segmentation is useful for calculation of Size Specific Dose Estimate (SSDE).  The segmentation of body axial CT images can be accomplished with well established techniques.  This allows a fast calculation of SSDE.  The SSDE is one of the best available parameters to optimize the tradeoff between the risk of radiation exposure, and the usefullness of the medical image for diagnosis.  If actual calculation of a patient's radiation exposure is required, more computationally complex techniques of x-ray photon transport simulation are required.  This program is useful only as an educational tool.  Currently, a large number of medical facilities are unaware of the usefullness of SSDE.
This repository contains both ".nb" format and ".pdf" format documents.  ".nb" are files that can be executed with Mathematica.
